================

TDMCreate is a module that create other basic modules for CMS Xoops.

Tested with xoops 2.5.7, you can not use it with earlier versions, unless because you do not fit some core files in the background and after some tests. 

Now that is ahead xoops versions, and goes to 2.6.0, you should download xoops 2.5.7 and use with this latest version. 

Therefore recommended not to use TDMCreate 1.91, with previous versions, to xoops 2.5.7
